That means the culture that we’re getting — in journalism and in media in particular — is coming from a very narrow viewpoint of people who don’t get harassed quite as much.

While I love writing books and having work that exists and doesn’t move, one of the cool things about being a writer online is that you can track your progress and the way your writing has changed throughout the years. Or, when I was blogging, I’d write something and someone in the comments section would say: ‘Well have you thought about this?’ And you can add on to your thoughts. It’s a constantly-moving discourse in a way that writing wasn’t before, and I think that is really exciting and useful.”"
